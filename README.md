# todo_App

This is an implementation of the basic **todo** app written on React and Rust  
The Backend code is built using *rocket* rs with *sqlite* embeded as the database  
The frontend code is built using react with Ts and Vite as build tool, as well as react router as only plugin  

## Usage
In order to use this app:
  - Create a sqlite file on the root directory of the backend folder
  - Add the neccesary tables, either with the sqlite CLI or using a GUI     

In order to launch this app:
  - Open 2 terminals, one in the React project and another one in the backend folder
  - Use `npm run dev` on the react terminal and `cargo run` on the backend terminal
  - Make sure that rust runs on localhost:8000 or adjust the frontend code according to your needs

*I might be terrible at coding, but at least im transparent about it, so feel free to copy paste whatever you think convenient*
